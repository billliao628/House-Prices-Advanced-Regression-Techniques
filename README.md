## Further Discussion
* If the score wanted to be increase, we can improve on few stuffs.
1. Do more EDA to see more first hand information that we might missed
2. Improve on data wrangling: it seems like some there are some columns that has value that doesn't make sense
3. Improve on tuning the Machine Learning Model
