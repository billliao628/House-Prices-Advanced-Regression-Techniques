## Further Discussion
#### If we want the score to improve(lower), we can improve on few stuffs:
* Do more EDA to see more first hand information that we might missed
* Improve on data wrangling: it seems like some there are some columns that has value that doesn't make sense
* Improve on tuning the Machine Learning Model
